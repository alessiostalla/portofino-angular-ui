## ManyDesigns Portofino 5 ##

Portofino is a web application framework written in Java and extensible using Groovy, distributed under the LGPL open
source license. It is developed by ManyDesigns, based in Genova, Italy (http://www.manydesigns.com).

The framework can be used to create good-looking applications for the Web and mobile devices. The creation process can include:
 - automatic generation through a "wizard" tool that analyses the structure of your existing relational database;
 - manual configuration through a web-based administration interface that lives alongside the application;
 - customization with Groovy (for the backend) and TypeScript (for the frontend).
 
The result is a fully functional application with a responsive web user interface based on Angular Material, a customizable backend fully exposed with REST-style APIs, authentication and authorization, an email subsystem and much more.
The application is designed to be incrementally extended and customized, both graphically and in functionality (e.g., adding new buttons to existing pages). When existing extension points are not enough, completely custom REST resources and Angular components can be developed and integrated, while retaining the possibility to use built-in services through dependency injection.

Development can happen "PHP style", i.e. by modifying a live application using a text editor, as well as "Java style", by employing an IDE, a build system, release and deployment.

Portofino is based on popular and proven open source libraries such as Hibernate, Groovy, Apache Shiro, Spring, Angular and Angular Material, Jersey JAX-RS.

resources (forums, wiki, issue tracker), commercial support.
